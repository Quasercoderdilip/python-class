#class methods : 

#Class methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than an 
#  of the class. They can be used to access and modify class-level data 
# (such as class variables). Class methods are marked with the 
# @classmethod decorator and take the class itself as their first parameter, 
# conventionally named cls.
